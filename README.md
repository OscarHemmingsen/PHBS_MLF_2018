# Outcome of NFL games based on the QB's performance

# Description

This project will use the statistics from different Quarterback performances over time dating back to 2002. Furthermore, we have collected the actual outcome of those game, so that we are able to match statistics from the QB's performance to the actual outcome. Hence, we will try to build a model that will be able to predict the outcome of an NFL-game based on the QB's performance.

# Goal of the project

The goals of this project are the following:
- Ability to predict the outcome of an NFL-game based on the Quarterbacks (QB) performance.
- Group performances "together" and quantify a "bad", "medium" and "good" performance.
- Being able to show the changes in the game over time based on data from the early 2000's.
