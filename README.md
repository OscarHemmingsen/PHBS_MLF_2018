# Outcome of NFL games based on the QB's performance

# Description

This project will analyse the stats computed by NFL quarterbacks from different games in the years 2000-2016. This is underlined in the saying of how important that position is in the sport. Therefore, by a categorized "good performance" the QB's team should be more proun to win the game. The data used will be stats compiled by quarterbacks as well as games won or lost by that QB's team.

# Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to see if it is possible to predict an NFL game based on the QB's performance. Performance in the NFL and typical American sports leagues are often based on statistics and metrics. Hence, it should be possible to classify e.g. "good", "medium" and "bad" performances. The position is by far in total and average the best paid position in the sport, which adds further suspense in our minds to the goal as to whether the QB's stats / performance can predict the outcome of the game.
